[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.23+-00ADD8?style=flat&logo=go)](https://go.dev/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Windows%20%7C%20Linux%20%7C%20macOS-lightgrey)](https://github.com/jaydenthorup/mremotego)

## Why MremoteGO?

**The Problem**: mRemoteNG uses XML configs that are painful to diff, merge, and share with teams. Passwords are awkwardly encrypted per-machine.

**The Solution**: MremoteGO uses clean YAML configs that work beautifully with git, plus optional 1Password integration for secure team password sharing.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Modern GUI** - Clean interface with connection tree, search, and quick actions
- 🔐 **Password Encryption** - AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with master password
- 🔑 **1Password Integration** - Store passwords securely using `op://` references
- 📝 **Git-Friendly** - YAML configs are easy to diff, merge, and review
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Windows, Linux, macOS (AMD64 & ARM64)
- ⚡ **Fast** - Native GUI with instant connections
- 🚀 **Multiple Protocols** - SSH, RDP, VNC, HTTP/HTTPS, Telnet
- 📁 **Organized** - Folders and search filtering
- 🔒 **Auto-Login** - Password injection for SSH connections
- 💻 **CLI & GUI** - Run without arguments for GUI, with arguments for CLI mode

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/jaydenthorup/mremotego/releases) page.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jaydenthorup/mremotego.git
cd mremotego

# Build (all platforms)
go build -o mremotego ./cmd/mremotego-gui

# Or use platform-specific build scripts
# Windows: .\build-gui.ps1
# Linux/Mac: ./build-gui.sh
```

### First Run

1. Launch `mremotego` (or `mremotego.exe` on Windows)
2. Optionally set a master password for encryption
3. Create your first connection or import from mRemoteNG

That's it! 🎉

## 📖 Usage

### GUI Mode

Simply run the executable without arguments:

```bash
./mremotego        # Linux/Mac
.\mremotego.exe    # Windows
```

**Creating Connections:**

1. Click **[+]** or press `Ctrl+N`
2. Fill in connection details (name, protocol, host, credentials)
3. Optionally push password to 1Password
4. Click **Save**

**Connecting:**

- **Double-click** a connection in the tree
- **Right-click** → **Connect**
- Select and press **Enter**

**Searching:**

- Use the search box at the top
- Filter by connection name, host, or protocol
- Results update in real-time

### CLI Mode

Run with arguments for command-line operations:

```bash
# List all connections
mremotego list

# Connect to a specific host
mremotego connect "Production Server"

# Add a new connection
mremotego add --name "New Server" --protocol ssh --host 192.168.1.100

# Export connections
mremotego export --output connections-backup.yaml

# Edit a connection
mremotego edit "Production Server" --host new.example.com

# Delete a connection
mremotego delete "Old Server"
```

### Example YAML Configuration

```yaml
version: "1.0"
connections:
  - name: Production
    type: folder
    children:
      - name: Web Server
        type: connection
        protocol: ssh
        host: web.prod.example.com
        port: 22
        username: admin
        password: op://DevOps/web-server/password  # 1Password reference
        description: "Primary web server"
        tags:
          - production
          - web
      
      - name: Database Server
        type: connection
        protocol: ssh
        host: db.prod.example.com
        port: 22
        username: dbadmin
        password: "enc:base64..."  # AES-256-GCM encrypted
        
  - name: Development
    type: folder
    children:
      - name: Dev Desktop
        type: connection
        protocol: rdp
        host: dev.example.com
        port: 3389
        username: developer
```

## 🔐 Security

### Password Storage Options

MremoteGO supports three password storage methods:

1. **1Password Integration** (Recommended for teams):
   - Store passwords securely in 1Password vaults
   - Use `op://Vault/Item/field` references in your config
   - Safe to commit configs to git
   - **Native desktop app integration with biometric unlock** (1Password SDK) Needs the Nightly Build of the 1password app and sdk enabled https://developer.1password.com/docs/sdks/desktop-app-integrations
   - No CLI commands needed - just unlock 1Password and go!
   - See [1Password Setup Guide](docs/1PASSWORD-SETUP.md)

2. **Encrypted** (Recommended for local use):
   - AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
   - Master password required on startup
   - Passwords stored as `enc:base64(salt+nonce+ciphertext)`
   - See [Encryption Guide](docs/ENCRYPTION.md)

3. **Plain Text** (Not recommended):
   - For testing or when other methods aren't suitable
   - Should not be committed to git
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude `connections.yaml` and `config.yaml`

### Best Practices

- ✅ Use 1Password for team environments (best UX with biometric auth)
- ✅ Use encryption for personal configs
- ✅ Add `config.yaml` and `connections.yaml` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use separate configs for different environments
- ✅ Regularly rotate credentials
- ⚠️ Never commit plain-text passwords to git
